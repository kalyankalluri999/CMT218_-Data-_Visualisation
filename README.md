# CMT218_Data_Visualisation
In this coursework, we were given a task to discuss the  visualization of data of our choice. It was important for us to  select a good visualization that would provide the theory  behind visualisation design and need to discuss improvements  that can be made to the visualization for making it more  effective. Additionally, it was also essential for us to consider  the visualisation within the context of the principles which were  discussed in the class and critically needs to analyse them.  After doing a bit of research I finally decided to select the “ UK  Elections” topic as it is one of the most complex and  complicated ones, which deals with a large amount of data,  Categorial features, and numbers.
